# Disney_dataset_creation
## I covered a range of Python and Data Science tasks in this project. They include
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with Pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
- Working with dates (datetime library)
- Saving & loading data with Pickle library
- Accessing data from an API using Requests library

## I scrapped the disney movie information and Wikipedia pages and ratings from IMDB. I plan to further analyze this dataset and gain valuable insights out of it.
